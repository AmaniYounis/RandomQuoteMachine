This is a random quote generator machine 
done by Amani Younis 
as a (1/5) final project for frontend libraries certification
of freecodecamp.com  
It has been developed using JavaScript React and Redux jQuery Bootstrap Sass
To Justify this point It has been done using React and Redux just for learning goals 
It shouldn't be developed using them -as a real project- because it is a simple project and using React and Redux may slow down the system 
plus that it took longer time to develop.
